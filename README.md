# Korean Entertainment Jobs Market Data Analysis: 2025
### Background and Overview of the Project
KoreanEntertainmentJobs.com is a global jobs board that publishes jobs, internships, and career opportunities in the Korean entertainment space outside South Korea. The platform features opportunities from companies across the K-Pop industry, Korean drama agencies, K-beauty retailers, K-Pop event firms, and startups.

Korean entertainment is an industry largely based in South Korea, and rightly so. But this platform was born out of a need to showcase the opportunities that exist outside Korea, and to give job seekers a chance to participate in the industry without necessarily having to relocate.

Throughout 2025, the platform tracked jobs, internships, volunteer, and career opportunities featured on its board. This project was undertaken to analyze that dataset and surface meaningful insights, including hiring trends, growing roles, popular job locations, and an honest look at what remote work in this industry actually looks like.
##### Below are the following areas where insights and recommendations were focused:
- Geographical distribution of jobs: Where K-entertainment jobs are located across the globe, broken down by country.
- Regional breakdown of jobs: How opportunities cluster across major world regions like North America, Asia, and Europe.
- Sector and department analysis: Which industries and job functions are doing the most hiring.
- Level of experience: What seniority levels companies are recruiting for, from entry-level to director.
- Compensation patterns: How pay (or lack of it) varies across locations, role types, and seniority levels.
- Remote work trends: The share of remote roles and what they actually offer in terms of pay and career growth.
